Because of my admission process and other commitments, this project might take more time than expected.  
I’m sorry for the delay, but I promise I’m giving my full effort to it. ❤️  
Even if nobody sees this, I still want to keep things transparent.  

At this point, only the **last few pages** are left.  
If everything goes well, the deployment will be completed by **7th September**. 👻 (because of some personal work) ☺️

>>I will update you all if it takes delay as i'm bringing new features.

> This project will be **optimized for PC only**.
