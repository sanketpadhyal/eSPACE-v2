Because of my admission process, personal work, and a bit of pressure, this project is taking slightly longer than planned.  
I’m sorry for the delay, but I promise I’m giving my full effort to it. ❤️  
Even if nobody sees this, I still want to keep things transparent.  

At this point, only the **last few pages** are left.  
If everything goes well, the deployment will be completed by **8th September**. 👻  

> If there’s any further delay, I’ll keep you updated as I’m also bringing in new features.  

⚡ This project will be **optimized for PC only**.
